# Denial of service
## Description
Some websites can detect devices exposed to the external network, through DDNS, and consequently obtain the IP addresses and ports of devices that are exposed. By using special usernames and special characters (such as half parentheses or square brackets), one can call the login interface and cause the session-management program to crash, resulting in customers being unable to log into their devices.
## Affected Product
● MT6000 /X3000 /XE3000 /A1300 /AX1800 /AXT1800 /MT2500 /MT3000 /XE300 /X750 /SFT1200 /AR300M /AR300M16 /AR750 /AR750S /B1300 /MT1300 /MT300N-V2
## Affected Firmware Version
● MT6000: 4.5.6, fixed in 4.5.8
● AX1800/AXT1800/MT2500/MT3000/A1300: 4.5.0, fixed in 4.5.16
● X3000: 4.4.6, fixed in 4.4.8
● XE3000: 4.4.4, fixed in 4.4.8
● XE300: 4.3.16, fixed in 4.3.17
● X750/SFT1200: 4.3.7, fixed in 4.3.11
● AR300M/AR300M16/AR750/AR750S/B1300/MT1300/MT300N-V2: 4.3.10, fixed in 4.3.11
## Exploit
1. Use any website that detects network devices to perform a device scan.
2. Obtain the open IPs and ports of the devices.
3. Invoke the login interface by using special usernames, special characters (such as half of a parenthesis or bracket).
## Impact
The attacker, by exploiting this vulnerability to invoke the login interface and inputting special characters (such as half of a parenthesis or bracket), can cause the session management program to crash, rendering the device unusable for users.
