## Exploit
1. During a brute-force attack, the administrator must be logged in, as the SID (Security Identifier) is only valid within an active session.
2. Accurately targeting the boot time (seed) in Unix timestamp format.
3. Utilizing the srand() and rand() functions of OpenWRT on GL's platform to generate the same SID as the one generated on the target device.
## Impact
By successfully exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) as a root user, hence having complete control of a target device.
