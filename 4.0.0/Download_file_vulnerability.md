# Download file vulnerability
## Description
The export log interface compresses the logs into lograd.tar and stores it in the /tmp directory, and then links it to /www/js/logread.tar. This causes the web to still be able to download logs after logging out. The same issue applies to the export configuration of the openvpn server.
